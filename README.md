# UI-kit boilerplate

Sample project to base your UI-kit from.

## Main features

- Component versioning. Components should never break backwards-compatibility. Write new version if old one doesn't cut it anymore;
- Based from the ground up on UI-kit components, it allows to easily support react-native & react, if you want to;
- Style reuse with `traits`. `Traits` are supposed to be basic design blocks which form your style and from which you can build up other components;
- Theming using themes with semantic colors; 
- Full customization using typed props

Main advantages of writing your own UI-kit are code reuse, visual consistency, enforcement of design constraints and HTML/CSS abstraction.

If done right, it significantly speeds up development and allows targeting multiple platforms without code rewrites. 

## Scripts
